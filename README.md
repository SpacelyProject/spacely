# Spacely

## What is Spacely?
Spacely is an open-source framework for testing ASICs.
Please refer to the main documentation at [spacely-docs](https://github.com/SpacelyProject/spacely-docs)

## What's in this repository?
All spacely code is found within the PySpacely folder.

ArduinoHAL is a hardware abstraction layer allowing Spacely to interface with Arduinos via a custom communication protocol. This part of the project is no longer under active development.

The Glue RTL2FPGA Source folder contains low-level LabView code for allowing Spacely to generate arbitrary digital waveforms on National Instruments PXI systems. Refer to [NI-PXI Glue Firmware documentation](https://github.com/SpacelyProject/spacely-docs/blob/main/special-topics/NI-PXI%20Glue%20Firmware.md)


## How do I collaborate?
Please refer to the main documentation at [spacely-docs](https://github.com/SpacelyProject/spacely-docs)

Spacely is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions that improve the codebase.
